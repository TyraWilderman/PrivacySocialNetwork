# Privacy Social Network

A decentralized privacy-focused social platform built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling anonymous social interactions while preserving complete user privacy on the blockchain.

## üîí Core Concept

**FHE Contract Anonymous Social Network** - A revolutionary privacy social platform that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption to create a truly private social networking experience. Users can interact, share content, and build connections without revealing their identities or personal data, while all operations remain verifiable on the blockchain.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Privacy-First Architecture
- **Anonymous Interactions**: All user activities are encrypted and anonymous by design
- **Private Reputation System**: Reputation scores calculated without revealing individual metrics
- **Encrypted Social Connections**: Follow relationships and interactions remain completely private
- **Zero-Knowledge Content Sharing**: Share posts and media while maintaining full anonymity

### Advanced FHE Implementation
- **Encrypted User Profiles**: Profile data encrypted using Fully Homomorphic Encryption
- **Private Engagement Metrics**: Likes, shares, and interactions processed without decryption
- **Secure Reputation Scoring**: Community-driven reputation system with privacy guarantees
- **Anonymous Social Graph**: Build your network while keeping all connections private

### Decentralized Features
- **On-Chain Privacy**: All social interactions recorded on blockchain with full encryption
- **Distributed Content**: Decentralized content storage with privacy preservation
- **Community Governance**: Private voting and community decision-making
- **Censorship Resistance**: Immutable and unstoppable social platform
